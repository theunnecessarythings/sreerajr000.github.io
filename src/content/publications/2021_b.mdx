  Significant advances in deep learning have obtained
  hallmark accuracy rates for various computer vision applications.
  However, advances in deep generative models have also led to the
  generation of very realistic fake content, also known as deepfakes,
  causing a threat to privacy, democracy, and national security.
  Most of the current deepfake detection methods are deemed
  as a binary classification problem in distinguishing authentic
  images or videos from fake ones using two-class convolutional
  neural networks (CNNs). These methods are based on detecting
  visual artifacts, temporal or color inconsistencies produced by
  deep generative models. However, these methods require a large
  amount of real and fake data for model training and their performance drops significantly in cross dataset evaluation with samples
  generated using advanced deepfake generation techniques. In
  this paper, we thoroughly evaluate the efficacy of deep face
  recognition in identifying deepfakes, using different loss functions
  and deepfake generation techniques. Experimental investigations
  on challenging Celeb-DF and FaceForensics++ deepfake datasets
  suggest the efficacy of deep face recognition in identifying
  deepfakes over two-class CNNs and the ocular modality. Reported
  results suggest a maximum Area Under Curve (AUC) of 0.98 and
  Equal Error Rate (EER) of 7.1% in detecting deepfakes using
  face recognition on the Celeb-DF dataset. This EER is lower
  by 16.6% compared to the EER obtained for the two-class CNN
  and the ocular modality on the Celeb-DF dataset. Further on the
  FaceForensics++ dataset, an AUC of 0.99 and EER of 2.04% was
  obtained. The use of biometric facial recognition technology has
  the advantage of bypassing the need for a large amount of fake
  data for model training and obtaining better generalizability to
  evolving deepfake creation techniques.
