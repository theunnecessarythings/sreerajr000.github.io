  Published studies have suggested the bias of automated facebased gender classification algorithms across gender-race groups. Specifically, unequal accuracy rates were obtained for women and dark-skinned people. To mitigate the bias of gender classifiers, the vision community
  has developed several strategies. However, the efficacy of these mitigation strategies is demonstrated for a limited number of races mostly,
  Caucasian and African-American. Further, these strategies often offer
  a trade-off between bias and classification accuracy. To further advance
  the state-of-the-art, we leverage the power of generative views, structured
  learning, and evidential learning towards mitigating gender classification
  bias. We demonstrate the superiority of our bias mitigation strategy in
  improving classification accuracy and reducing bias across gender-racial
  groups through extensive experimental validation, resulting in state-ofthe-art performance in intra- and cross dataset evaluations.
