<h2>Abstract</h2>
  <p>
  Significant advances in deep learning have obtained
hallmark accuracy rates for various computer vision applications.
However, advances in deep generative models have also led to the
generation of very realistic fake content, also known as deepfakes,
causing a threat to privacy, democracy, and national security.
Most of the current deepfake detection methods are deemed
as a binary classification problem in distinguishing authentic
images or videos from fake ones using two-class convolutional
neural networks (CNNs). These methods are based on detecting
visual artifacts, temporal or color inconsistencies produced by
deep generative models. However, these methods require a large
amount of real and fake data for model training and their performance drops significantly in cross dataset evaluation with samples
generated using advanced deepfake generation techniques. In
this paper, we thoroughly evaluate the efficacy of deep face
recognition in identifying deepfakes, using different loss functions
and deepfake generation techniques. Experimental investigations
on challenging Celeb-DF and FaceForensics++ deepfake datasets
suggest the efficacy of deep face recognition in identifying
deepfakes over two-class CNNs and the ocular modality. Reported
results suggest a maximum Area Under Curve (AUC) of 0.98 and
Equal Error Rate (EER) of 7.1% in detecting deepfakes using
face recognition on the Celeb-DF dataset. This EER is lower by
16.6% compared to the EER obtained for the two-class CNN
and the ocular modality on the Celeb-DF dataset. Further on
the FaceForensics++ dataset, an AUC of 0.99 and EER of 2.04%
were obtained. The use of biometric facial recognition technology
has the advantage of bypassing the need for a large amount of
fake data for model training and obtaining better generalizability
to evolving deepfake creation techniques.
